## Introduction

Any realistic model of a real-world phenomenon must take into account the possibility of randomness. That is, more often than not, the quantities we are interested in will not be predictable in advance but, rather, will exhibit an inherent variation that should be taken into account by the model. So to build such a model, we need some measure to quantify the randomness, and this can be achieved by studying the *theory of probability.*
This is the first blog of my **Introduction to Probability and Statistics** series, where I would post materials related to probability and statistics, every machine learning enthusiast should be aware of. So let's begin by defining some elements of probability theory.
